## Overview
This repo was created to describe the process of learning and using [Webpack Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) in learning and building a [micro-frontend architectures](/docs/other-learning-material.md#micro-frontends).


>   I would like to express my sincere and biggest thanks to [Manfred Steyer](https://github.com/manfredsteyer) and [Eduardo Serrano](https://github.com/edumserrano) as well as the engineers who have contributed knowledge to the community about microfrontend-architectures.
My job here is just to collect, reuse and guide new people so that they do not have too much difficulty 


**This repo structures the tutorial from the most basic concepts, if you are a newbie like me at the time of learning what Micofrontend really is, you should go through each example presented.**

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are a knowledgeable person and have the ability to learn quickly, you can completely refer to the [Reference](#references) section because here you can actually get the most intuitive description possible.

## Usage

**Read the [Example Notes](/docs/code-overall.md) before exploring the code demos.**

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use `github.dev` to explore the code demos without cloning the repo. As long as you're logged in to `github.com`, you can just press `.` (dot) on this repo page and the repo will be opened in the `github.dev` editor, a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser.

| [basic-module-bundlers](/examples/basic-module-bundlers/README.md) </br></br> Create your first webpack manually               | We should know how like Angular, React or Vue bundle and create interfaces. There is no magic here but we will also go from the basic concepts of web programming and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) is a tool born to do this better. |
| [basic-web-component](/examples/basic-web-component/README.md) </br></br> Web Component in action with Angular | Basically you will know how Angular creates web components and how to use them.                                                                                                                                                                     |
